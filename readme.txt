Seamless WooCommerce checkout with 35+ payment methods, built-in 3D Secure, saved cards, and refunds managed from your order screen.

== Description ==

Mastercard Merchant Cloud gives your WooCommerce store a fast, familiar checkout backed by Mastercard's payment gateway — supporting 35+ payment methods and multi-currency for global selling, with built-in security and simple integration.

= Why merchants use it =

* **Improve conversion** — fast, familiar checkout with flexible flows and optional saved cards that reduce friction and cart abandonment.
* **Reduce fraud** — built-in 3D Secure and risk controls protect transactions without hurting the customer experience.
* **Operate efficiently** — capture, void, and refund directly from the WooCommerce order screen, with webhooks keeping your store and the gateway in sync.

= Flexible checkout options =

* **Hosted Session** — embedded secure payment fields with saved-card support.
* **Hosted Checkout – Embedded** — Mastercard-hosted form inside an iframe.
* **Hosted Checkout – Redirect** — standalone Mastercard page for the lowest PCI effort.

= Features =

* Authorize-only or authorize-and-capture payment actions
* Saved cards
* 3D Secure authentication
* Full and partial refunds and voids from the order admin
* Webhook notifications for real-time synchronization
* Logging and debugging tools
* Translation-ready

= Security =

* Tokenization and secure processing handled by Mastercard
* PCI-optimized flows; sensitive card data never handled or stored by your store

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the Mastercard Merchant Cloud payment gateway (Mastercard Gateway API) to process payments. This service is required for the plugin to function. The gateway endpoint is region-specific and selected by the Merchant Region you configure (for example `https://<region-gateway-host>/api/rest/...`). This service is provided by Mastercard.
